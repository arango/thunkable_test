Notes from PL:

Started running up against the time limit, so left a few things undone. I tried to get fancy and make use of Ant Design's editable typography for the inline editing to show that I was making an effort at using Ant. This was a bad idea, since it does some bizarre resizing thing after changing the data and completely breaks the drag and drop stuff I have in there. I left it in there, since I didn't have time to get in and figure out what was going on.

Otherwise, I think it's all functional. There were some bizarre items in the Figma that, in a real work environment, I would talk to the designer about (i.e., "Do you really mean for the page background to change depending on whether there are projects or not?", "Does the stroke under the header really come and go like that?"). I would probably also break out that App.tsx file if this was real code, but decide to keep it simple for now. Didn't get around to tests, which I would have liked to have done, but only had so much time to work on this.
